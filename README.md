# moodbased-music-recommendation-using-brainwaves

The Mood-based Music Recommendation System using Brainwaves is a novel approach to suggest music based on an individual's current mood, as measured by their brainwaves. The system uses electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to capture brainwave activity, and then applies machine learning algorithms to classify the user's mood. The system recommends music tracks that match the user's mood, which enhances their listening experience and emotional well-being. The proposed system has the potential to revolutionize music recommendation systems and provide a more personalized and intuitive listening experience.
